# House Haunt Game
<p> House Haunt is a game I created using JavaScript and WebGL for my 
computer graphics final project. </p>


<p> In this game you are a ghost exploring a house in some sort of after-life dream world. 
Each room in the house holds some sort of personal significance for the ghost. The goal is to explore all of the rooms
and the surrounding world to find five objects. Because you are a ghost you cannot pick the objects up but simply observe them. </p>
